# Super Mario World Power Ups (and Question Block) 
I used www.pixelartcss.com to recreate the power ups from my favourite Nintendo game, Super Mario World (1990)
Also, had taught myself and implemented CSS grid in this project for the layout of the boxes.

Hope to add jQuery and CSS animations to spice things up.
